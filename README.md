## Description

The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This program provides a simple way to encrypt and decrypt messages using a user-defined shift value.

## Features

- Encrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Decrypts messages that were encrypted using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters, leaving them unchanged.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher-program.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd caesar-cipher-program
```

## Usage

Run the program using Python:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```

Follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt a message:

1. Type `encrypt` to encrypt a message or `decrypt` to decrypt a message.
2. Enter the message you want to process.
3. Enter the shift value (an integer).

The program will display the resulting encrypted or decrypted message.

## Example

```plaintext
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Program!
Type 'encrypt' to encrypt or 'decrypt' to decrypt: encrypt
Enter your message: Hello, World!
Enter the shift number: 3
The resulting text is: Khoor, Zruog!
```
